# Current state

Updated: 2026-09-18 (second entry; hosted research session).

## Objective

Prepare the first discovered prediction task for a monthly public release. Scout
runs on NousCloud with **1.9 GiB RAM and about 6 GB persistent disk**, coordinating
Docker jobs on temporary Hetzner workers. Each published dataset gets its own
public repository and versioned GitHub Release assets.

## Ready in this repository

- Revised project specification, agent instructions, handoff and first assignment.
- Completed hosted inventory; reuse native research, browsing and scheduling.
- Candidate tracking and stdlib worker lifecycle: cost reservations, interrupted
  creation recovery, SSH dispatch, direct private uploads, verified collection
  and confirmed cloud cleanup.
- Independent GitHub Actions expiry sweeper, disabled until configured.
- Tiny synthetic infrastructure smoke job and local failure-path tests.
- A public dataset README template describing the eventual release contract.
- Hosted GitHub access verified: clone, branch push/deletion, release and run
  listing, successful CI. `gh` v2.101.0 installed after checksum verification.
- Private staging repo `earino/dataset-factory-staging` (builder-created). Its
  restricted worker token is still needed.
- `scripts/scout-factory` launcher with `_FILE` credential paths, `doctor`
  credential presence assertions and live memory reporting.

## Completed on the hosted instance, 2026-09-18 (second session)

- Pulled `01a84a1` and read `deployment/BUILDER-REPLY.md`.
- `sh scripts/scout-factory doctor` runs and reports memory, GitHub CLI, benchmark
  and credential state. `doctor --require-worker-credentials` exits 1 with both
  credentials reported missing or unusable, as expected before provisioning.
- All **30** tests pass locally under Python 3.13.5 (the builder reported 30 on
  GitHub Actions as well).
- SSH: generated ed25519 keypair `/opt/data/.ssh/scout_worker_ed25519`
  (fingerprint `SHA256:k4Uk+aJCEV28M7xvwsIzE3v0agPBXNrPXN/GGRFusms`, comment
  `scout-dataset-factory-worker`). No key existed before; nothing was overwritten.
  The public key is recorded in `deployment/ssh-worker-public-key.md` for Hetzner
  registration. Not yet registered.
- Secrets: created `/opt/data/.secrets` (0700). Both token files are still absent;
  only the operator can supply them, and only into those paths.
- Policy: `config/local.json` created from the example with `enabled: false`,
  `monthly_budget_eur: 0`, empty `allowed_locations` and `server_types`, staging
  repo set, SSH key paths set. Ignored by Git. Paid launches remain impossible.
- Benchmark checkout re-inspected: `data/prepared/` is absent, all three
  preparation scripts and saved baselines are present. Preparation must happen on a
  worker.

## Worker credentials verified 2026-09-18 (third session)

Both worker credentials now exist and have been tested against their real APIs.

**Hetzner.** `HCLOUD_TOKEN` stored at `/opt/data/.secrets/hetzner.token` (0600, in
a 0700 directory). Tested with the token file only — the environment variable was
removed from the test subprocess, which asserted its absence first. A single
read-only `GET /v1/servers` returned **HTTP 200**, so authentication succeeds and
the dedicated project currently contains **0 servers**. No create, modify or
delete call was made.

**GitHub staging.** `FACTORY_GITHUB_TOKEN` stored at
`/opt/data/.secrets/github-staging.token` (0600, same 0700 directory), 93
characters, a fine-grained token. Tested with the file explicitly and
`FACTORY_GITHUB_TOKEN` removed from the environment:

- `earino/dataset-factory-staging` is reachable and **private** (default branch
  `main`).
- Scope is genuinely restricted: the token sees exactly **one** private repository
  across the account — `earino/dataset-factory-staging` — while a probe of
  `earino/dataset-factory` returns **HTTP 404**. It is not the broad classic PAT
  used for coordinator git access, and the coordinator login was left untouched.
- A uniquely named **draft** release was created (`verify-staging-1789728610`),
  a 125-byte test file uploaded, and the server-reported size (125) and digest
  (`sha256:d50a3893513699526aea43828dfc2a633411b310a80f97259e36f2abbf0e07a5`)
  matched the locally computed values. The release stayed unpublished throughout.
- Cleanup succeeded: asset delete 204, release delete 204, subsequent reads of both
  returned 404, zero releases remain, no leftover tag. The draft-releases path
  workers depend on is therefore verified end to end.

`sh scripts/scout-factory doctor --require-worker-credentials` now exits **0** with
both credentials reported ready and an empty error list.

**Worker SSH key registered 2026-09-18 (fourth session).** The existing dedicated
ed25519 pair at `/opt/data/.ssh/scout_worker_ed25519` (0600, directory 0700, no
passphrase) was reused rather than regenerated; its public key derives cleanly from
the private key, so it is suitable for unattended use. Hetzner held no SSH keys
before this, so the public key was registered as **`scout-worker`**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `scout-worker` |
| ID | `130171155` |
| Fingerprint (MD5) | `9d:80:95:90:cc:4c:c8:65:83:59:9f:8c:2b:d6:ae:30` |
| Verification | read back via `GET /v1/ssh_keys/{id}`; public key matches the local pair |

The read-back fingerprint equals the locally computed MD5 fingerprint, so the
registration is confirmed rather than assumed. `config/local.json` now carries
`ssh_key_name: scout-worker` and `ssh_private_key:
/opt/data/.ssh/scout_worker_ed25519`. Launches stay disabled and the allowance
stays at zero.

Remaining prerequisites for a paid launch: notification delivery, an observed
scheduled cleanup run, and verification that the sweeper deletes an expired server.
The allowance is configured (see the seventh-session section), the cleanup secret
and variables are configured, and the manual dispatch executes successfully.

## Primary expiry cleanup configured 2026-09-18 (fifth session)

Actions secret `HCLOUD_TOKEN` set from `/opt/data/.secrets/hetzner.token` using file
input, so the value never appeared on a command line or in output. Repository
variables set: `FACTORY_PROJECT` = `earino-dataset-factory` (the exact `project`
value in `config/local.json`) and `FACTORY_CLEANUP_ENABLED` = `true`. The local
policy was left untouched: `enabled` false, `cleanup_configured` false,
`monthly_budget_eur` 0, empty `server_types`.

### Manual dispatch - verified executing, not skipped

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| URL | https://github.com/earino/dataset-factory/actions/runs/35337787612 |
| Event | `workflow_dispatch` |
| Status | completed / success |
| Created (UTC) | 2026-09-18T11:04:09Z |
| Updated (UTC) | 2026-09-18T11:04:19Z |
| Job | `cleanup` - success, started 11:04:13Z |
| Step | "Delete only expired project workers and orphaned job IPs" - success |

The job's own output:

```json
{"deleted_servers": [], "deleted_primary_ips": [], "errors": []}
```

**What that proves, and what it does not.** Proven: the secret and variable wiring,
the workflow's enablement gate (`vars.FACTORY_CLEANUP_ENABLED == 'true'` now
passes), execution on a GitHub runner, and a successful authenticated Hetzner query
issued from GitHub's infrastructure. An empty `errors` list is meaningful here: a
bad or missing token would have surfaced there.

**Not proven: deletion of an actually expired server.** This project has never
contained a server, so the deletion path - non-empty `deleted_servers`, the
ownership re-check before delete, and labeled primary-IP cleanup - is entirely
untested. Verifying it is a smoke-cycle step, not a cleanup-scheduler step.

### Scheduled run - pending at time of writing

No `schedule`-event run appeared between enablement (2026-09-18T11:04Z) and
2026-09-18T11:15Z, despite cron minutes 7, 22, 37 and 52. GitHub documents that the
`schedule` event "can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions
workflow runs", that high load includes the start of every hour, and that queued
jobs "may be dropped" under sufficient load
(<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule>).
Scheduled workflows run in UTC on the default branch, and here the workflow file is
already on `main`.

Observed cadence is also much looser than configured. Before enablement the
workflow produced `schedule` runs at 2026-09-17T19:19Z, 22:16Z, 2026-09-18T00:28Z,
05:07Z and 09:53Z - roughly every two to four hours, not every fifteen minutes.
Those runs were correctly `skipped` by the gate.

Scheduler fire time, and therefore the first genuinely scheduled execution, remains
**unverified**. The manual dispatch above stands on its own as execution evidence.
The interval was changed to hourly at minute 17 later the same session; see the
sixth-session section.

### Open item for the operator

With the gate open, each run executes and bills a minimum of one Actions minute. At
the configured 96 runs/day that is roughly 2,880 minutes per month, against GitHub
Free's 2,000 minutes per month for private repositories. Widening the interval to 30
or 60 minutes, or confirming a paid allowance, should be decided before this is
relied on.

## Cleanup cadence changed to hourly 2026-09-18 (sixth session)

Deletion on collection stays the normal path; the scheduled sweep is the backstop.
Because GitHub can delay scheduled runs - and can drop queued jobs under load - the
interval is **not a strict deletion deadline**.

- `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml` now runs `17 * * * *` (hourly at minute 17), with
  `workflow_dispatch` retained for manual runs. Minute 17 is deliberately off the
  hour, which GitHub documents as a high-load period for scheduled workflows.
- `cleanup_grace_minutes` raised from 30 to 60 in `config/worker.example.json`
  (tracked) and `config/local.json` (ignored, so not committed).
- The policy accepts the value: the check is `15 <= cleanup_grace_minutes <= 60`, so
  60 is the maximum permitted. Verified offline that 60 passes and that 90 is
  rejected with "Cleanup grace must be 15-60 minutes"; an offline `worker plan`
  under a stand-in policy completes with `cloud_calls: 0`.
- Measured effect on reservations, which are `ceil((lifetime + grace) / 60)` hours:
  unchanged for 45, 60 and 120-minute lifetimes; the reserved hours rise for
  short jobs (15 and 30-minute lifetimes go 1 -> 2) and for a 90-minute job (2 -> 3).
  The extra hour is therefore charged only where it crosses an hour boundary. It is
  a conservative reservation, not a provider billing cap.
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` gained a "Sweep cadence and cleanup grace" subsection. It
  records that an empty `deleted_servers` list is the expected sweep result while
  the normal delete-on-collect path is working, and that Scout deletes a worker as
  part of finishing its job rather than waiting for the sweep.
- Launches remain disabled and the allowance unchanged: `enabled` false,
  `cleanup_configured` false, `monthly_budget_eur` 0, empty `server_types`. No cloud
  resource was created or modified.

**First scheduled run under the new cron is pending.** It is written here at
2026-09-18T11:26Z rather than claimed, because no `schedule` run appeared under the
previous 15-minute interval during the roughly twenty minutes it was enabled. See
the fifth-session section above for the earlier observation and the manual dispatch
that did execute.

## Compute allowance configured 2026-09-18 (seventh session)

`config/local.json` (ignored, so not committed) now carries the operator's initial
allowance: `monthly_budget_eur` 20, `allowed_locations` `["hel1"]`, `server_types`
`{"cx23": 0.02, "cpx32": 0.08, "cpx42": 0.15}`, `max_workers` 1,
`max_lifetime_minutes` 120, `cleanup_grace_minutes` 60. Values are **maximum
all-in hourly EUR prices including VAT and the primary IPv4**. Working guidance:
CPX32 by default, CX23 for light jobs, CPX42 when a job needs more memory.
`enabled` and `cleanup_configured` remain false, so launches are still impossible.

### Ceilings verified against live prices

Checked through the real launch-time code path (`factory.worker.check_price`) against
the live `/pricing` payload for `hel1`, where the comparison is
`server_gross_hourly + ipv4_gross_hourly > ceiling -> refuse`:

| Type | Ceiling EUR/h | Live server + IPv4 gross/h | Result | Headroom |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cx23` | 0.02 | 0.011520 | pass | 0.008480 |
| `cpx32` | 0.08 | 0.069240 | pass | 0.010760 |
| `cpx42` | 0.15 | 0.134640 | pass | 0.015360 |

Primary IPv4 is 0.00096 EUR/h gross. Prices are identical in `fsn1` and `hel1`. A
future price rise larger than the headroom makes `launch` refuse rather than
overspend, which is the intended fail-closed behaviour.

### Offline smoke-job plan

A copy of `examples/smoke/job.json` with `server_type: cpx32` and `location: hel1`
was planned under the proposed allowance (temporary files under `.factory/`, which
is ignored). Result: `reserved_hours` 2, `reservation_eur` **0.16**, `cloud_calls`
0, `enabled` false. Across the allowed types for that 45-minute job: `cx23` 0.04,
`cpx32` 0.16, `cpx42` 0.30.

At the maximum 120-minute lifetime the reservation becomes 3 hours: `cx23` 0.06,
`cpx32` 0.24, `cpx42` 0.45. The EUR 20 allowance therefore admits roughly 333
max-lifetime `cx23` jobs, 83 `cpx32` jobs or 44 `cpx42` jobs.

This is an admission estimate, not a billing cap. Note that a single continuously
running `cpx32` bills about 42.59 EUR/month gross, so the allowance only protects
while jobs stay bounded and are deleted on collection.

### Remaining prerequisites before the live smoke cycle

1. Notification delivery, so a failed or dropped scheduled run is visible.
2. An observed `schedule`-event cleanup run that executes rather than skips.
3. Verification that the sweeper actually deletes an expired server - untested, as
   this project has never held one.
4. `cleanup_configured: true` and `enabled: true`, set only once 1-3 hold.

## Research shortlist recorded 2026-09-18

Five candidates created with measured evidence in `candidates/<id>/record.json`
and `notes.md`. All numbers below were measured live on 2026-09-18 through
anonymous public APIs; none is a scored result.

| Candidate | Domain | Scale measured | Licence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `austin-911-response` | public-safety operations | 1,049,636 calls, 2023-2026 | Public Domain | **lead** |
| `chicago-doah-adjudication` | administrative adjudication | 823,637 rows, 2008-2027 | See Terms of Use | runner-up, licence review needed |
| `noaa-tide-flooding` | coastal water levels | 302 stations, all with flood thresholds | public domain (US Gov) | shortlisted |
| `melbourne-pedestrian-counts` | urban activity sensing | 1,621,901 hourly records | unconfirmed | shortlisted |
| `md-sewer-overflow` | wastewater infrastructure | 27,479 events, 2005-2023 | Public Domain | lower priority; series may be stale |

Lead choice: `austin-911-response`, because its licence is explicitly Public Domain
while Chicago's is "See Terms of Use", and the project must publish publicly.
Remaining work on the lead is technical, not legal: confirm the `response_time`
derivation, exclude the post-hoc columns listed in its notes, measure the
`response_time` distribution, freeze threshold T from the training window, and split
temporally by `response_datetime`.

No baseline, AUC, headroom figure or acceptance verdict has been measured. Nothing
here should be read as a result.

## Still unverified or unimplemented

Local tests use fake providers. **No live Hetzner/GitHub worker cycle has been run.**
Boot, SSH, Docker, uploads, recovery, costs and scheduled deletion remain unverified.
Worker policy stays disabled at zero allowance.

The benchmark adapter (`factory/bench.py` coordination, `workers/benchmark.py`
execution), qualification tools, public exporter and website are not implemented.
`../harness_benchmark` is unmodified.

The cleanup workflow is still skipped: `FACTORY_CLEANUP_ENABLED`, `FACTORY_PROJECT`
and the `HCLOUD_TOKEN` Actions secret are unset, so no manual or scheduled run has
been observed. Notification delivery is unconfigured.

## Next actions for Scout

1. Finish the lead candidate's construction script: confirm the `response_time`
   derivation and `mental_health_flag` timing from the dataset's column docs, then
   encode the dispatch-time-only feature list and the threshold protocol.
2. Continue shortlist work that needs no credentials: confirm the Melbourne licence,
   verify the 2023+ Maryland overflow dataset, and measure NOAA per-station
   exceedance base rates from bounded samples.
3. Operator: register the worker public key with Hetzner and set the allowed
   server types and locations with an allowance. Worker credentials are already in
   place and `doctor --require-worker-credentials` passes.
4. After that: verify the primary GitHub Actions cleanup with a manual and a
   scheduled successful run, add the secondary on-host cron sweep, run the live
   smoke cycle, and only then enable paid launches.

## Inputs still needed from the operator

Compute/inference allowance with allowed server types and locations, cleanup
secret/variable setup and a notification destination. Both worker tokens and the
worker SSH key are supplied and verified.
Both worker tokens are supplied and verified. First release date, reviewer, public
dataset namespace and website hosting can wait until the first candidate is
approved.
